	<h1> Using bike share and subway to commute </h1>

  	<p> Buenos Aires City is the capital and largest city of Argentina (almost 3 million inhabitants). The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. The subway is the most popular (near 30 million users monthly) and fastest (26 minutes average time from the peripheral terminals to Downtown) mode of transit. But, the subway network is not so well spread. This leaves zome areas of the city poorly connected to downtown. As many cities, Buenos Aires has a bike-share system called Ecobici with 179 thousands registered users. It is totally free of charge and has more than 83 stations. At the same time, the city has one of the most extended network of protected and exclusive bike-lanes (158 km) that makes Buenos Aires the 14th most bikeable city in the world according to copenhagenize.org. Nevertheless, bike-share stations are located in the downtown area, in competition rather than cooperation with the subway. We propose to deploy bike-share stations in the peripherals areas as a way to improve access to the subway network in a smart, flexible, low-cost and environmentally friendly way. The main idea is for people living close (but not close enough to walk) to a subway station, can bike to the subway and from there to work.</p>
